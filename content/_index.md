# Git

Git is a type of version control system (VCS) that makes it easier to track changes to files.
For example, when you edit a file, git can help you determine exactly what changed, who changed it, and why.

It’s useful for coordinating work among multiple people on a project, and for tracking progress over time by saving “checkpoints”. You could use it while writing a book, or to track changes to artwork and design files.

Git isn’t the only version control system out there, but it’s by far the most popular. Many software developers use git daily, and understanding how to use it can give a major boost to your resume.

In complex projects, where multiple people might be making changes to the same files simultaneously, it’s easy to get into a weird state. Anyone who’s dealt with “merge conflicts” and those baffling >>>>>>> ======= <<<<<<< symbols can attest to this.

If you start to understand how git works, you’ll see why conflicts occur and how to recover from these situations easily.
